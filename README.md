👋 Hello, I'm Dennis! Currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at Boston University. 

I primarily focus on Python programming and have experience working with various libraries and frameworks. Currently, I am working on a discord bot that monitors the price movement of the stock market (NYSE) and the news associated with the price fluctation. I am still strengthening my skills in Python, HTML, and CSS, so I strive to deepen my understanding of software development, algorithms, and data structures. I find immense joy in solving intricate problems and leveraging the power of Python to create efficient and elegant solutions.

I am always excited to connect with like-minded developers, researchers, and tech enthusiasts. If you're interested in collaborating, discussing innovative projects, or sharing insights on Python programming and its applications, please don't hesitate to reach out.

✉️ Feel free to contact me. Let's work together to build remarkable software solutions that make a lasting impact! 💪💻
